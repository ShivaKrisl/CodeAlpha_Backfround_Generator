# CodeAlpha_Background_Generator
This project aims to develop a background color as per user choice. User need to enter his/her wish color and then click on set color button.
Then automatically user desired color is generated. User can also download the color in '.png' format with image size of 1024x1024 by clicking on the download button. An alert functionality is also added so that If user enters an invalid color then error prompt is displayed.

Inorder to generate color here I have used 'tinycolor' javascript library you can find it from here : https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tinycolor/1.4.2/tinycolor.min.js
